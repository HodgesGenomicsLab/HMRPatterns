# HMRPatterns
This is a repository of scripts used for the analyses within Scott &amp; Hodges, 2023 ("Cross-tissue patterns of DNA hypomethylation reveal genetically distinct histories of cell development").

DNA hypomethylated regions (HMRs) were processed by MethPipe (http://smithlabresearch.org/software/methpipe/) and HMR/.meth/.read files are available publically from the "methbase" trackhub from UCSC. (Download links are generally: http://smithdata.usc.edu/methbase/data/Hodges-Human-2011/Human_[CELLTYPE]/tracks_hg19/Human_[CELLTYPE].hmr.bb or http://smithdata.usc.edu/methbase/data/Roadmap-Human-2015/Human_[CELLTYPE]/tracks_hg19/Human_[CELLTYPE].hmr.bb).

Data used in these scripts is publically available.
